# SPIRIT WEAPON FOR ZELDA QUEST AETERNAL CHANGELOG


### Alpha 2 Build 1. April 27th 2020

- Introduced the Changelog and the To Do List
- Amended the advice on quest rules and settings within the readme to now specify the correct rule to turn off in 2.55 and mandates the addition of the script setting that enables objects to use floating point positions
- Rewrote the movement types so they no longer utulize work values with the new floating point positions LWeapons get
- Fixed a bug where suspending the header culls weapon step speed, leaving them not having engine movement even after the header is re-enabled.
